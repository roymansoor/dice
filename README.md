# Pokedex

I used vite and react to create this simple application. 
There are two die components and each will shake and get a random number between 1 and 6, when clicked on. Check your luck! You won't be able to click again the button so wait for a second to check your luck and do it again. 
I have developed the app on GitHub so you can check it out.

## Demo
